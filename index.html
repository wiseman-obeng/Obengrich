      <u><h1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICE AND QUANTITY DEMANDED</h1></u>
      <p>This inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded is as a result of the law of demand, which state that the higher the price the lower the quantity demanded and the low the price the higher the quantity demanded.(ceretirus parabus). This result in a negative slope of the demand curve. As a rational consumer compare the marginal benefit and cost of consuming a particular commodity there will be an inverse relationship since a rational consumer will maximized consumption with low cost.</p> 
       <p><h2>Substitution Effect:</h2> When the price of a commodity rises, consumers often seek alternatives that fulfill the same need or want at a lower cost. For example, if the price of coffee increases, some consumers might switch to tea, leading to a decrease in the quantity of coffee demanded.</p>
        <p><h2>Income Effect:</h2> A price increase reduces consumers' purchasing power, effectively making them feel poorer. This can lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded of normal goods, as people cannot afford as much as before. For instance, if the price of smartphones doubles, fewer people may be able to buy them.</p>
         <p><h2>Diminishing Marginal Utility:</h2> As consumers purchase and consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction (or utility) they gain from consuming each extra unit decreases. Therefore, they are only willing to buy additional units at lower prices. For example, a person might buy one bottle of water at $2 but would only consider buying a second one if it costs less.</p>
<p>	<h2>Opportunity Cost Consideration:</h2> Higher prices increase the opportunity cost of buying a particular commodity, as consumers weigh what they must give up to afford it. This often leads them to reduce their demand for the good.</p>
